<h2 align="center"> AVENTRI: A Hybrid Event Management Application

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increasingly rapid development of information technology has now spread in almost all fields such as education, daily life, business, health, facilities, transportation, and government. They have enhanced the ability to exchange knowledge, and accelerate the flow of information and communication. One of the things that people are into, and they really enjoy are attending events. And these events are somehow already coping up with what technology has to offer now. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events play an important role in our society. Any happening or an activity can be referred to as an event. Individuals often find they lack the expertise and time to plan events themselves. Independent planners are needed to step in and give these special events the attention they deserve. In the current scenario, planning an event requires a lot of patience and hustle bustle right from deciding the theme to deciding venue and events. Lots of factors need to be considered while making each decision. Also once the party is planned a lot of on the day issues such as maintaining low noise levels after a particular time, or neighbors complaining about the noise levels etc. take the fun out of the party/event.
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration, queuing, and manual check-in are just a few of the many jobs that event organizers had to do. These processes are often carried out using traditional or manual methods. But, gone are the days when people register for events by filling out paper registration forms and writing a check. Not only is it old school, but it’s out-dated by comparison to some of the more modern streamlined processes. This problem can be solved easily by applying  modern technology. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event Management Application (EMA) is a web based application that supports online registration and feedback evaluation for event training programs such as games, seminars and workshops. It helps program attendees, organizers, the authors and the reviewers in their respective activities. Development of an event management system is an attempt to address the problems of managing registration forms, feedback forms and evaluating feedback. The main goal of this system is to give a working solution to store, manage and consolidate the registration data and the feedback data. When using an online registration application, the participants can simply register at their convenience and submit their information immediately. The participant can do corrections as needed without worrying about erasing or cutting. The information the participant sends will be immediately loaded into the database. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers don’t have to worry about sorting the information submitted by participants; the database will be updated automatically, and that is a massive advantage in terms of saving time. The main benefit of a good online registration system is it creates one simple collection point for all information you require from  delegates, presenters and exhibitors.
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With “Aventri", it is an online event registration application that aims to improve efficiencies and eliminates unnecessary paperwork, it also maximizes participation and improves marketing capabilities while allowing participants to sign up when and where it is most convenient for them. Evento will eliminate all the manual intervention and increase the speed of the whole process. System will allow users to fill the form online, system has inbuilt validation system to validate the entered data. Application will generate the result instantly and store the results for further use. Improve management productivity, satisfaction and retention by eliminating paper trails and manual processes with complete online management for handling management for registration of events. Manage all users information easily in a comprehensive record that includes users information. Simply Event Management System with easy record management. <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SDGs which this project aims to attain are Decent Work and Economic Growth, Sustainable Cities and Communities and Partnerships for the Goals. These SDGs are further described as follows:


 <b>Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</b></h3>

<h3> Purpose and Description </h3>
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participants can register at home, in their office, or anywhere as long as they have a mobile device and Internet connectivity. Within five minutes done anytime anywhere, they could secure their spot by inputting a few simple pieces of information via their mobile device. A confirmation email will be sent immediately after to let the registrant know that the transaction went through. The ability to track data is critical. The numbers and statistics are automatically computed using event management software. It also considers recent changes, such as new registrations and those who choose not to attend after previously registering. The registration process is a good idea but a crucial aspect of the event. The registration is where they get the raw data and the proponents  needs to make sure the rest of the planning goes smoothly. With nearly everything going digital these days, it makes perfect sense to keep up with the times and make the necessary changes to streamline the process for both officers and students. It stands to reason that if the registration process is as simple as a few clicks and filling out a few blocks of information, you'll get a higher registration response rate.
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evantri focuses on the events transaction reservations; showing all the events that are going to be covered for the selection of the organizations then the system will give a reservation form for the attendees to fill out. The Admin will be able to view, check and update the reservations that are pending and determine their status. Providing contact details where attendees can interact with the event planner (admin) to meet up to discuss further about the event. The Admin can also delete or cancel the event if there’s a hanging event on a specific date, and only the admin can log-in on the admin page using Username and Password for the security of all records.

<h3> Significance of the Proposed Project </h3>
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the developed system is to make the registration a snap for the attendees. In order to manage such issues the proponents require an easy to use system that will help in effectively tracking such problems.  In this application, the proponents are going to make use of the aforementioned technology through which the event  system and management is made feasible with the help of a customized application.  
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience registration will only serve as a request at first until the system admin or management will reach back to the possible audience to talk or verify the audience registry confirmation for the event. Aventri focuses on the online reservations of events where admin(s) can easily show, add, edit, delete, monitor and secure all the reservations. Users must provide personal information in the form to be filled up, for booking an appointment. This research is highly significant to the following recipients:
