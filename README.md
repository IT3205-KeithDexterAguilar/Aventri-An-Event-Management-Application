<h2 align="center"> Aventri: A Hybrid Event Management Application

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
<p align=justify>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increasingly rapid development of information technology has now spread in almost all fields such as education, daily life, business, health, facilities, transportation, and government. They have enhanced the ability to exchange knowledge, and accelerate the flow of information and communication. One of the things that people are into, and they really enjoy are attending events. And these events are somehow already coping up with what technology has to offer now. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events play an important role in our society. Any happening or an activity can be referred to as an event. Individuals often find they lack the expertise and time to plan events themselves. Independent planners are needed to step in and give these special events the attention they deserve. In the current scenario, planning an event requires a lot of patience and hustle bustle right from deciding the theme to deciding venue and events. Lots of factors need to be considered while making each decision. Also once the party is planned a lot of on the day issues such as maintaining low noise levels after a particular time, or neighbors complaining about the noise levels etc. take the fun out of the party/event.
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration, queuing, and manual check-in are just a few of the many jobs that event organizers had to do. These processes are often carried out using traditional or manual methods. But, gone are the days when people register for events by filling out paper registration forms and writing a check. Not only is it old school, but it’s out-dated by comparison to some of the more modern streamlined processes. This problem can be solved easily by applying  modern technology. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event Management Application (EMA) is a web based application that supports online registration and feedback evaluation for event training programs such as games, seminars and workshops. It helps program attendees, organizers, the authors and the reviewers in their respective activities. Development of an event management system is an attempt to address the problems of managing registration forms, feedback forms and evaluating feedback. The main goal of this system is to give a working solution to store, manage and consolidate the registration data and the feedback data. When using an online registration application, the participants can simply register at their convenience and submit their information immediately. The participant can do corrections as needed without worrying about erasing or cutting. The information the participant sends will be immediately loaded into the database. 
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers don’t have to worry about sorting the information submitted by participants; the database will be updated automatically, and that is a massive advantage in terms of saving time. The main benefit of a good online registration system is it creates one simple collection point for all information you require from  delegates, presenters and exhibitors.
<p align=justify> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With “Aventri", it is an online event registration application that aims to improve efficiencies and eliminates unnecessary paperwork, it also maximizes participation and improves marketing capabilities while allowing participants to sign up when and where it is most convenient for them. Evento will eliminate all the manual intervention and increase the speed of the whole process.
